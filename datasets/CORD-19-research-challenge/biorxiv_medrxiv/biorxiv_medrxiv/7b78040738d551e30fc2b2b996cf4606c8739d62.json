In this model, we consider two types of movement: daily work commuting and random movement. Information on county-to-county work commuting is publicly available from the US Census Bureau 2 . We further assume the number of random visitors between two counties is proportional to the average number of commuters between them. As population present in each county is different at daytime and nighttime, we model the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 separately. We recognize that in the days leading up to March 13, some control measures were implemented in some areas of the country (e.g. school closure, closing of restaurants and bars, etc.); while these measures likely reduced inter-county movement to some degree, these effects were not likely large during this time period.",

The reductions of contact rates disrupt normal mixing within metapopulation locations, whereas the travel restrictions impact mixing between locations. In particular, we ran model simulations with no intervention, a 25% reduction of contact rate, a 50% reduction of contact rate and a 95% reduction of cross-county mobility. The epidemic curve is more effectively flattened by reduction of the contact rate, as shown in Fig. 2 . In addition, we provide movies of each scenario (Movies S1-S4 10 ).
