Here, we propose that daily population-wide surveys that assess the development of symptoms caused by the virus could serve as a strategic and valuable tool for identifying such clusters to inform epidemiologists, public health officials, and policy makers. We show preliminary results from a survey of over 38,000 Israelis and call for an international consortium to extend this concept in order to develop predictive models. We expect such data to allow: Faster detection of spreading zones and patients; Obtaining a current snapshot of the number of people in each area who have developed symptoms; Predicting future spreading zones several days before an outbreak occurs; Evaluating the effectiveness of the various social distancing measures taken, and their contribution to reduce the number of symptomatic people. Such information can provide a valuable tool for decision makers to decide which areas need strengthening of social distancing measures and which areas can be relieved. Researchers from the U.S, Spain, and Italy have adopted our approach and we are collaborating to further improve it. We call with urgency for other countries to join this international consortium, and to share methods and data collected from these daily, simple, one-minute surveys.",

This new isolate was named 2019-nCoV and is the cause for the COVID-19 disease ( Na Zhu et al. 2019 ). The virus has led to an ongoing outbreak and an international health crisis. Update reports of the World Health Organization (WHO) state that at the moment there are at the low hundreds of thousands confirmed cases and thousands of deaths of patients who were infected by COVID-19 globally 1 . This number is rapidly increasing and most probably is a vast underestimation of the real number of patients worldwide, as infected individuals are contagious even when minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic 2 . The spread of the disease has presented an extreme challenge to the international community. Although the WHO issues health policies recommendations, many policy-makers from different countries have chosen and implied different strategies. These strategies depend on many factors, including the local spread of COVID-19, healthcare system resources, economical and political factors, public adherence and their perception of the situation.",

This additional information provides real time analysis of symptoms over the course of days as people are getting sick and render an informative situation snapshot.",

These include cough, fatigue, myalgia (muscle pain), shortness of breath, rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, diarrhea and nausea or vomiting. In addition, participants were asked about the existence of one of the following chronic health conditions: Diabetes mellitus, Hypertension, Ischemic heart disease, Asthma, chronic lung disease and chronic kidney disease.

The characteristics of the responders are described in Table 1 . The Israeli MOH guidelines have instructed individuals who return to Israel from anywhere in the world to be placed under home isolation for 14 days from their date of return to Israel starting from March 09, 2020. In addition, individuals that were in close contact as defined by being within approximately 2 meters (6 feet) of a COVID-19 case for more than 15 minutes were also instructed to be in home isolation for a similar time period 6 . Altogether, 1,509 (4.02%) responders reported that they are currently in isolation. For those reported as being in isolation, 774 (51.3%) responders were due to a recent international travel and 751 (49.7%) were due to a contact with an individual who was infected with coronavirus or an individual who recently returned from any destination abroad.",

Our initial analysis based on the preliminary data already reveals a different rate of symptoms in responders from different cities which are geographically close to each other, which might hint at the ability to detect changes in a high geographical resolution ( figure  3 ). As expected, we are also detecting a higher percentage of symptoms among individuals who are in home isolation, compared to those who are not (0.07 and 0.05 respectively).",

We therefore hypothesize that these symptoms may reflect other respiratory infections which are prevalent in Israel during this period (such as an infection caused by an influenza virus), as many of these diseases share common symptoms 9 . If our hypothesis is correct, this rate can be viewed as a baseline rate that will allow us to further detect subtle changes which may reflect a spread of COVID-19 infection. These findings encourage us to reach as much of the population as we can in a minimal amount of time to actively create a reliable baseline of the symptoms for the population.",

First, while it does not have the ability to diagnose individual cases of COVID-19 infection, it may help predict future spreading zones a few days before an outbreak occurs, with a high level of accuracy given a sufficient sample size. We currently provide a colormap of Israel by regions of symptoms ratio (figure 3), however, as the daily response rate will increase, enough data will be collected, enabling us to implement prediction models. These we hope would be leveraged by policy-makers to make informed decisions, by utilization of efficient regional prevention strategies rather than a universal approach. Second, it may also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of prevention strategies implemented by public health organizations, such as the various social distancing measures which are currently being employed in many countries, including Israel. This can be done by measuring the effect of different strategies on reducing the number of symptomatic individuals. Third, it may help in understanding the clinical course of COVID-19 infection by tracking the dynamics of symptoms in the population over time.",
