The pathogen causing the outbreak of disease was identified as a novel Coronavirus (termed SARS-CoV-2), belonging to the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, all of which are enveloped, non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses (3, 4) . According to the WHO and Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the current gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is based on the real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). However, RT-qPCR is reported to have issues of low positive rates for throat swab samples (5) and there were 3% of patients who had negative RT-qPCR test results at initial presentation while chest CT checks indicated typical symptoms of viral pneumonia (6) . In order to identify and hospitalize COVID-19 patients in time, more sensitive and accurate tests are required.",

Quantification is performed by applying Poisson statistics to the proportion of the negative partitions to account for positive partitions that initially contained more than one target molecule. dPCR can offer greater precision than qPCR and is far simpler to use for copy number quantification due the binary nature in which the partitions are counted as positive or negative. Additionally, dPCR is more tolerant of PCR inhibition compared with qPCR due to partitioning and because it is an end-point PCR measurement and consequently less dependent on high PCR efficiency (10, 11) .",

Among the 103 specimens, 81 (P1 to P81) were tested at KXR with the H&R qPCR kit and 7 (P82-88) were tested at WHCDC by the Daan qPCR kit. Firstly, the criteria claimed by the H&R kit manufacturer are: Ct value\u226435 are positive, Ct value >39.2 are negative, and 35<Ct<39.2 are equivocal. The criteria of the Daan qPCR kit are: ct>40, negative, ct =<40, positive, and equivocal if only one gene with ct =< 40 and no amplification for another gene. According to such criteria, 14 positive, 25 negative and 49 suspected SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported by qPCR. For dPCR, three targets are tested in parallel and the determination of a positive result should meet the following criteria: quantification of any one of the three gene targets is \u2265 2 copies/ reaction. If no positive droplet was detected in FAM channel but positive droplets were detected in VIC indicating RNAseP positive for human reference control(18), the sample can be judged negative. If 0<result<2, it should be attributed to equivocal and need further check. According to such criteria, 44 out of 49 suspects and 17 out of 25 negatives were corrected to be positive by dPCR and the positive rate significantly increased. No positive droplet was detected for the 6 negatives and copy numbers were quantified under the established LoD for 7 suspects infections, due to either no virus sampled or ultra-low virus load in these specimens. 15 samples (from P89-P103) were tested at BJCDC with BioGermqPCR kit and assays recommended by Chinese CDC.

However, 15 out of 16 equivocal and one negative can be determined positive by dPCR. The suspect rate was significantly decreased from 21% down to 1% according to the detection of dPCR. Consequently, except 5 patients can not be tracked, the rest 10 dPCR positive were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 infected patients based on a follow-up survey.",

This would improve the false negative rate by applying multiple methods. However, diagnostics of nucleic acids is still considered as the gold standard as this is the most direct way to detect the presence of the virus. Thus, the established digital PCR method in this study could be a powerful complement method because it can significantly improve the positive rate for the suspect patients. Furthermore, it is very sensitive for the very low virus load in close contacts and suitable for monitoring the change of the virus load in the convalescent patients. An additional advantage of quantification of SARS-CoV-2 copy number by dPCR is that comparisons can be conducted between different dates and different laboratories as absolute quantitation of targets by dPCR provides high concordance between sites, runs and operators(14, 23, 24). However, it is not possible to compare Ct values on different runs or different machines. Thus, dPCR is an ideal method to for measuring the change of virus load in the convalescent patients.",
