While information specific to COVID-19 is limited, a model using complications due to other upper respiratory infections can be used as a proxy to help identify those individuals who are at the greatest risk.

Additionally, the metrics quantifying the effectiveness of our models are in Table 3 . As you can see, the performance of both Gradient Boosted Tree models are very similar. The ROC curve demonstrates that even as the decision threshold increases, the percentage of the potentially affected population increases at roughly the same rate. Similarly, the Logistic Regression model has similar performance at low alert rates. We can see that at a 3% alert rate, the difference in sensitivity is only .02. The performance at higher alert rates experiences a significant performance disadvantage, however, for most interventions this would be at alert rates higher than is practical.",

As stated, we have released an open sourced version of the model, available at https://github.com/closedloop-ai/cv19index. This model is written in the Python programming language. We have included synthetic data for the purpose of walking individuals through the process of going from tabular diagnosis data to the input format specific for our models. We encourage the healthcare data science community to fork the repository, and adapt it to their own purposes. We encourage collaboration from the open sourced community, and pull requests will be considered for inclusion in the main branch of the package. For those wishing to use our models within our platform, we are providing access to the COVID-19 model free of charge.
