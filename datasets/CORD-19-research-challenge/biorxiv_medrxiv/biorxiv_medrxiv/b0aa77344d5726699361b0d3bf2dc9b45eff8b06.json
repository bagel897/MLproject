In previous section the tense is simple present. So let's stick to it. The epidemic trend of 147 countries are first simulated all over the world, and the peak number of confirmed cases and its arrival time in each country are predicted (See Appendix 2 for details). As is shown in Table 2 , according to different peak value intervals, these countries are divided into six different categories. Among these categories, the highest one includes Spain and Italy, whose peak values are higher than 100,000 based on our simulation. 18 countries including France and Iran have peak values higher than 10,000. And the peak values of most of these contries come after May, 2020. Thirteen countries have peak values ranging from 1000 to 10,000, and all of their peak values arrive after April 18, 2020. Mexico and other 20 countries have peak values ranging from 100 and 1,000. 42 countries have peak values between 10 and 100 and the peak values arrive between March 21, 2020 and April 23, 2020. Moreover, 51 countries of 147 have peak values under 10, which arrive before the middle of April according to our simulation. Italy and Spain monopolize one category, out of all 147 countries, due to its high exposure to the risk of the coronavirus. It should be stressed out that these two countries should take effective measures to overcome the epidemic as soon as possible. According to our estimation, the peak number of real-time confirmed cases of Italy is predicted to reach 108,062, and its arrival time is on May 6, 2020. As one of the worst-hit countries, Italy has already seized the world's attention. The major reason of this outbreak is that the public in Italy doesn't take quarantine seriously.

Poland, Japan and several other countries are the next worst-hit areas with their peak value over 1000. As for the peak value between 100 and 1000, we consider these countries as potential-disaster-area. The development trend of them firmly rely on the actions they take to confront the SARS-CoV-2. Once powerful measures are taken, the epidemic will be likely to be under control. To our relief, the most dangerous countries in this category including Belgium and Singapore are taking actions to strictly suppress the transmission.

China is an exceptional research object, since it broke out several months ago, and have already been under control effectively. And Denmark is one of the latest to reach its peak. Ultimately, we take a broader view at the six continents of the world. From Table  4 , we can observe that Africa has the the minimum peak value and the second earliest peak arrival time. There are only two countries in Oceania for our study, the sparse of population makes it easier to reach the peak value quickly.

As of March 15, 2020, the cumulative number of patients is 81,059 in China, while the total population in Europe is about 740 million. Under the current transmission environment and government measures, the estimated number of patients is likely to be 703,215. Based on the above data, the per capita prevalence rate in Western Europe will be at least 15.4 times higher than that in China. Without timely response measures, Western Europe has become a more serious epidemic area than southeast Asia.",

Under the circumstances of social unrest and economic sanctions, it is very difficult and urgent to control the epidemic situation in Iran. In addition, the peak values of Qatar and Saudi Arabia are both estimated to be over 5,000. In particular, ithe maximum daily increase in the number of patients is 238 in Qatar, while the base number has reached 427.",

Up to now, although there's no direct evidence to prove that wearing masks can inhibit the spread of the epidemic, the phenomenon of crowd gathering in airports and other places in the United States still exists, and many people have not taken any isolation and protection measures. 1 1 Given that the epidemic has spread in the United States (2,726 cases in total, as of March 15, 2020) , if the current situation is maintained, the peak number of cases in the United States will reach 14,454. In addition, Canada is expected to have a peak value of 1,866, making it the second most affected country in the region. It can be seen clearly that the most countries or regions where the outbreak is expected to occur has relatively developed economy, trade and their people flow are relatively large. Timely isolation measures are necessary and the epidemic situation is urgent. The cumulative number of global patients will finally be 892,950 (95% CI: 335,922 -24,930,386).",
