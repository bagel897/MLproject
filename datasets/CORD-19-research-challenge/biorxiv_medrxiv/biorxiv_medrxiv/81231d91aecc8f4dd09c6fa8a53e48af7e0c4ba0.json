The first point is to help calm down the atmosphere of society and to avoid tension in societies, and the second is to properly interpret the COVID-19 case fatality ratio (CFR) in Iran and calculate it tactfully. It should be taken into account in interpreting this index, since the denominator of the fraction is only positive, and the death rate is positive among the positive cases. This index should also be calculated until the end of the epidemic period, and if it is until the end of the epidemic and their outcome (death/recovery) is determined, this indicator will approach the real number. The third point is to recommend personal hygiene, in particular hand washing and avoiding contact with suspected patients, discovering unknown cases of infection and early detection and isolation of patients, which is emphasized by the healthcare system to overcome this disease. One article reported that up to 70% of the supply chain could be cut off and the epidemic could be controlled if contact and isolation, quarantine and isolation were appropriately accomplished (18).",

Based on Von Bertalanffy's Growth Model (the most realistic model), the maximum patients of COVID-19 are 19,500. According to the method of east squared error, this value was estimated to be 48830. For prediction of cumulative recovered cases of COVID-19 patients in Iran, three models of growth (Figure 2 a, b, c) were used. The growth rate of Gompertz's model is , so the number of is 1.75. According to Figure 2 and the models of von and Gompertz for prediction of recovered patients, the model estimated the number of recovered individuals to be 6500 and 11800, respectively. Moreover, according to Figure 3, the maximum population of recovered individuals was estimated 21000 according to the method of east squared error. To predict and estimate the number of deaths due to COVID-19, two growth models (Figure 2) and the east squared error (Figure 3) were used to maximize logistic growth in the most optimistic manner. According to logistic, Von and east squared error method, the number of deaths will be 1707, 3165 and 6300 individuals, respectively. study, for the first time in Iran, to monitor the process of COVID-19 epidemic, prediction and estimation of the number of patients, , deaths and recovered individuals were performed and reported based on mathematical and statistical models. Although this prediction may be associated with random errors, it was made with assumptions about the past trends of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran as well as the behavior of the people and government interventions. One point that may change our estimates is that we are at the end of the solar year and are less than 10 days longer than the Iranian New Year (Nowruz 1399) and New Year's with long vacations may increase visits, travels, and other activities. It is a rigorous government and health care intervention that may be implemented more and more strictly on these days. Moreover, according to a valid scientific report, delay in the onset of symptoms until the isolation of patients plays an important role in controlling the epidemic. To achieve 90% control of the epidemic, 80% of the cases need to be tracked and isolated. The epidemic is controlled when a new infection does not occur 12 to 16 weeks after the initial cases of the disease (18). Therefore, it is recommended that efforts be made to control the epidemic with greater vigor and urgency and to conduct a daily risk assessment. In the current epidemiological situation in the world and Iran, fear control and avoidance of rumors are very important for the prevention and control of coronavirus.",

Complete reliance on any type of model will lead to systematic error, unless modeling provides a prediction with precise and clear assumptions and inputs and outputs. Given the assumptions in Iran, the prediction of the patients on 3 April (Farvardin 15), 2020 with the three growth models of Gompertz, von Bertalanffy and the least squared error were estimated at 27000, 19500, and 48830, respectively. The number of recovered individuals was estimated up to 6540 individuals according to von's model, 11800 ones according to Gompertz model, and 21000 ones according to least square method. The number of deceased COVID-19 patients was also estimated to be 1707 individuals using the logistic growth model, 3165 ones by von's model and 6300 ones according to the LSE method. If enforcement and public behavior interventions continue with current trends, the control and reduction of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran will be felat from late May 2020, and new cases are expected to decline from mid-April of the following Iranian new year. This study suggests that government interventions and people's behaviors determine the persistence of the epidemic and should be addressed with greater responsibility, accountability, rigor, and quality.

In Iran, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on February 19, 2020 (30 Bahman, 1398 in Iranian calendar) from Qom and until March 21, 2020. According to the Daily Reports in Iran, 14991 COVID-19, 853 deaths and a crude mortality ratio of 5.7% were reported (17). Universities, schools, public places and shrines were closed. People are referring to health centers and hospitals, and the public is almost alarmed by the epidemic of panic and inaccurate reporting in cyberspace. The recurring and important questions are: How is the size of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Iran and how long and when will the epidemic go down? We cannot answer these questions with certainty, but it can be investigated in terms of pathogenic behavior (coronavirus), host conditions, behavior (human) and environmental factors of coronavirus transmission, and the use of modeling given the assumptions and the percentage of error. Indeed, although the models are different, multiple, and changeable in nature and do not insist on the correctness of the forecasts, the decision-making conditions for health policy-makers and authorities are more transparent and helpful (18). This study aimed to model and determine the epidemic trend and predict COVID-19 patients in Iran using mathematical and statistical modeling. This study is a secondary data analysis and mathematical modeling based on a research proposal approved by Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences (Code of Ethics Committee on Biological Research IR.SKUMS.REC 1398.254) (19). For the statistical analysis of definitive COVID-19 patients in Iran, daily reports of the Ministry of Health and Medical Education were used. The definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 was made using virus isolates from patients' biological samples and confirmed by the Reference Laboratory located in the Pasteur Institute of Iran were",
